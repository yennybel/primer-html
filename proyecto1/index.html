                <h2>Life coaching is consulting</h2>
                <h3>Our platform addresses 3 foundational areas that affect the life you build: Life Goals, Work and communication.</h3>
                <h3>It's strategy, support and implementation.</h3>

                <p>It's not Therapy or Counseling, to treat specific mental health issues. It is an 
                    empowering and proactive approach to Living Well and achieving Life Goals 
                    by adding a different vantage point. In sports, we have coaches because it's 
                    difficult to see everything clearly while you are in the game! In life we also 
                    need someone holding us accountable to the steps of our strategies. It's 
                    necessary to have someone objectively tell us when our strategies need to 
                    be adjusted. This is an essential element to Winning!

                <p>That's what we're offering, someone to be there every step of the way.</p>
